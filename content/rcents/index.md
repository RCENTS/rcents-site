In addition to reproducing the results reported by the by the corresponding publications, we are also perform a comparitive evaluation of the data by establishing and thoroughly exploring benchmark datasets from multiple next generation sequencers, multiple types of biological organisms, in multiple application contexts, and at multiple scales
